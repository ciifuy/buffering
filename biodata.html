                    hi, i'm bana, and i'm not exactly sure how to start this without sounding like interview, so i guess i'll just talk the way i am: a little weird.<br>
                    <br>
                    i'm currently 20 years old. people say this is the age when you start figuring out who you are. honestly? i think i'm still floating between "i kinda know what i want" and "what is happening?".<br> 
                    <br>
                    i'm a computer science student, which basically means i spend half my time staring at screens and the other half wondering if i'm the bug. 
                    people think it's all logic and structure, but honestly it's 10% coding, 20% stack overflow, and 70% questioning my life choices at 3 a.m. 
                    with five terminal windows open and no idea which one is running the server.<br>
                    <br>
                    my interests go from silly things to heavy stuff—like rock music that hits hard, random late-night thoughts about the universe, and coding stuff that either works or crashes everything. 
                    i find peace in things that are too big to understand: black holes, cosmology, quantum mechanics, relativity.<br>
                    <br>
                    i'm naturally distant person—not because i have hard feeling toward anyone, but because i need space. physical, mental, emotional. 
                    i don't open up easily, not because i don't feel, but because i often feel too much and have no idea what to do with it. <br>
                    <br>
                    getting too attached with someone overwhelms me, and sometimes distance is the only way i know to keep myself steady.
                    i'm not always easy to read. sometimes i go quiet not because i'm upset, but because i need space to clear my head. i need time to think, breathe, and recharge.
                    but when i care, i really care. i'm just not always good at showing it. <br>
                    <br>
                    i'm mix of introvert and selective chaos. i like people, but i also like not talking to them for two weeks.
                    i make decisions in 0.2 seconds and regret them in 0.3. my coping mechanism is being random and saying word random stuff.
