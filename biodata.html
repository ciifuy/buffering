                    hi, i'm indri, but you can call me bana, and i'm not exactly sure how to start this without sounding either too serious or too careless—so i guess i'll just talk the way i think: a little weird.<br>
                    i'm currently 20 years old. people say this is the age when you start figuring out who you are. honestly? i think i'm still floating between "i kinda know what i want" and "what is happening?".<br> 
                    i'm a computer science student, which basically means i spend half my time staring at screens and the other half wondering if i'm the bug.<br> 
                    people think it's all logic and structure, but honestly? it's 10% coding, 20% stack overflow, and 70% questioning my life choices at 3 a.m. with five terminal windows open and no idea which one is running the server.<br>
                    <br>
                    my interests range from things that make no sense to things that feel too heavy—music that hits in the gut, random late-night thoughts about the universe, and coding stuff that either works like magic or crashes everything.<br>
                    i find peace in things that are too big to understand: black holes, cosmology, quantum mechanics, relativity.<br>
                    <br>
                    i'm someone who usually prefers space—physical, mental, emotional. i don't open up easily, not because i don't feel things, but because most of the time i feel too much and have no clue what to do with it.<br>
                    i used to think i was just numb or detached, but recently i learned that being calm doesn't mean you don't care. sometimes, it just means you're trying not to drown.<br>
                    <br>
                    personality-wise, i'm a mix of introvert and selective chaos. i like people, but i also like not talking to them for two weeks.<br>
                    i'm the type of person who makes decisions in 0.2 seconds and regrets them in 0.3. my coping mechanism is being weird and saying random stuff.<br>
                    <br>
                    i'm not always easy to read. sometimes i go quiet—not because i'm upset, but because i need space to clear my head. i just need time to think and recharge.<br>
                    but when i care, i really care. i'm just not always great at showing it.<br>
